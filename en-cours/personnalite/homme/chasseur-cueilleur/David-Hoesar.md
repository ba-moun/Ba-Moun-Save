Dia!kwain was imprisoned for culpable homicide at the Breakwater Convict Station (his prisoner number was 4434) and served four years of a five-year sentence along with his brother-in-law ≠kasin whom he joined at Mowbray in 1873. At the time he arrived there he appeared to be in his late twenties (his prison record stated he was 25). The details of the incident that led to Dia!kwain’s and ≠kasin’s imprisonment are not clear but it appears that Dia!kwain shot a farmer who had threatened to kill his family. The judge gave Dia!kwain a relatively light sentence of five years for culpable homicide, believing him to have acted in self-defense.

Dia!kwain contributed over 2000 pages of narrative to Bleek and Lloyd, as well as several drawings. His father was trained as a ‘sorcerer’ or ‘magician’ and was said to have made paintings on skin and engravings.

Dia!kwain returned to Mowbray for the second time on the 13th June 1874. He accompanied his sister !kweiten ta ||ken and brother-in-law ≠kasin and two of their young children. He remained at Mowbray after Bleek’s death in August 1875 and eventually left on the 7th March 1876 for Calvinia. He was anxious to visit relations and hear news of his children. Dia!kwain worked in Calvinia for a while in the employ of  Dr H Meyer and later went into the country to visit one of his sisters, leaving some of his wages in Dr Meyer’s care. Dia!kwain intended to pass back through back through Calvinia and then return to Mowbray, but he never collected his pay and was not heard from again despite Dr Meyer’s enquiries as to his whereabouts. According to Jan Plat (who left Calvinia with Dia!kwain), interviewed by Lloyd in January 1884 (see page 6046ev), he had heard that Dia!kwain accompanied a farmer called ‘Louw’ (whose sheep he had been keeping) to Kenhardt and then the Free State, possibly in search of his sons who Dia!kwain thought might be in that region. It is also possible, according to a story Janette Deacon unearthed, that Dia!kwain was killed by friends of the farmer he shot, in an act of retaliation.
